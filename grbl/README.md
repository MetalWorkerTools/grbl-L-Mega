New features in the current [CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) release require GRBL changes. These changes are implemented in this GRBL fork. The [Compiler Options](https://github.com/HuubBuis/grbl-L-Mega/wiki/Changed-Compiler-options) are described in the [GRBL-L-Mega Wiki](https://github.com/HuubBuis/grbl-L-Mega/wiki). For all other information read the [GRBL Wiki](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki)  
I have added spindle sync threading G33 based on [fschill grbl version](https://github.com/fschill/grbl-Mega/tree/spindle_sync) to this GRBL-L-Mega version and the version for the Arduino Uno [GRBL-L](https://github.com/HuubBuis/grbl-L). Read the [threading setup Wiki](https://github.com/HuubBuis/grbl-L-Mega/wiki/Threading-setup-and-use) for an explanation of the threading setup.
